# Typical College ADTs Solved Exercises

## What is this:
This repository is a collection of typical lab exercises for subjects regarding efficient algorithms USING data structures or others of the sorts. 

**It contains solved exercises about linked lists, stacks, trees, hash tables and the creation of efficient data structures to store and find data 
based on some client's specifications using the aforementioned as building blocks.**

Every folder contains one of these exercises with the statement. *This is all educational, divulgative code containing my solutions 
to some classic college assignments with the lowest computational complexity achievable.*

## How to use:
Inside each folder there is a PDF with the assignment description. The code used to make it work is in the rest of the files, which have to be
compiled and ran by a C++ compiler/IDE of your choice. I would like to point out here that the files in each folder with each assignment are
the ones **necessary** to make it run, not the best nor worst ones to approach and solve the problem, they are just the types I chose to use.
The complexity order of the solution is the lowest one achievable for each problem though.

## How to learn from it:
My advice is to read the assignment, then get the files that you think you will need to complete the task that it specifies from any folder, then
after you finish your version of the solution make sure the computational complexity is the bare minimum you can achieve and the input/output works, 
then compare it to my files. If the complexity order is the same, regardless of which abstract data types you chose to use, congratulations, you completed the exercise
successfully.

Sometimes there exist some special cases regarding input/output that can be tricky, if you find yourself in a dead end my advice is that 
you refrain from looking at my files and start over *at least once* with a different approach. If your computational cost is of a higher order than the ones in my 
solution, know that some teachers can fail you for it even if the input/output is perfect, so you should rework your solution.

Hope you find this repository useful,
    MW.

### Disclaimer:
Some of the abstract data types in the folders like the linked lists and queues, as well as the trees were not coded by me. 
My code is was what was asked in the assignment descriptions, ergo, what you will get asked in college in these subjects.
You can actually use the C++ ADTs versions, and as long as you use the analog functions the code will work just the same.
