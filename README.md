# CollegeAbstractDataTypesLabs
Abstract data type implementation typical assignment solutions to college assignments of second year subject Efficient Data Structures.

##What is this:

This repository is a collection of typical lab exercises for subjects like efficient algorithms for data structures or other of the sorts.
Every folder contains one of these exercises with the statement. This is all educational, divulgative code. 

##How to use:
Inside each folder the assignment description exists inside a PDF. The code used to make it work is the rest of the files, 
which have to be compiled and ran by a c++ compiler/IDE of your choice. 

Disclaimer: The abstract data types like the linked lists and queues, as well as the trees were not coded by me. All I coded was what was asked in the assignment descriptions.
